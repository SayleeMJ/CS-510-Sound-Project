## Project Overview

The Synthesizer App for Android is a digital music-makingÂ application that allows users to create and control tones directly from their devices. Users can generate unique sounds by adjusting pitch and volume through a simple and easy interface. The program supports real-time audio synthesis and the option to save compositions for later playing.

### What is the project?

This Android application is intended to function as a digital synthesizer. It generates tones based on pitch and loudness input from the user, making it an interactive tool for creating music or sound effects.

### How does it work?

Users can control the pitch and volume of the sound using SeekBars. The application generates tones in real-time, allowing for dynamic audio creation. Users can also save their compositions as audio files to their device, enabling them to compile and share their creations.

## Building and Running

To build and run the Synthesizer App:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure you have the Android SDK installed and configured.
4. Connect an Android device or use the Android Emulator.
5. Build and run the application through Android Studio.


### Example of Operation

1. Open the app.
2. Use the pitch SeekBar to select the desired pitch.
3. Adjust the volume SeekBar to set the volume.
4. Press the "Play" button to hear the generated tone.
5. Press the "Add Note" button to save the tone.
6. Use the "Save Composition" button to save all added notes into a file.


### What Worked

- Real-time audio synthesis based on user input.
- Saving compositions to files for playback.

### Challenges

- Ensuring smooth audio playback across different devices.
- Implementing an intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

### Satisfaction and Future Improvements

I am pleased with the functionality of generating and altering tones. However, I intend to improve the app by adding more features such as:
- Adding a greater variety of synthesizer effects.
- Users can create more complicated pieces by arranging numerous notes and tracks.
